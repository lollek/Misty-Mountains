Rogue14 - Mod 1
  Changed to GNU/Linux-compability only
  Made the highscore always sort by scores, and not players

  Startup/Flags:
    Removed -d flag as it didn't make any sense to me
    Added --help flag
    Added --version flag
    Added --restore flags, which does the same as -r
    Added --score flag, which does the same as -s
    Added -S/--seed=NUMBER, which sets the map seed
    Added -E/--escdelay=NUM, which set the ESCDELAY

  Controls:
    Shortened the ESC delay as much as possible
    Removed the '!' command for shell escape
    Removed the 'v' command to check version
    Added '^Z' command, which has the same idea as the '!' command had,
      but instead of forking a new shell, we just pause the game.
      Basically, we send a SIGSTOP to the program.
      After doing your shelly stuff, you can continue with the fg command.
    Removed keypad support and character support for many strange systems
