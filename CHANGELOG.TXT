  Too many changes to mention. Misty Mountains is only based on Rogue14, not the
  same game.

Rogue14:
v1.3.2
  Visual:
    Removed tombstone
    Changed high score texts a bit

  Tweaking:
    Throwing arrows now always miss (use 'a'ttack instead)
    Ring hunger is now a bit lower (and slow digestation is stronger)

  Bugs:
    Ring hunger (and slow digestation) now affects the player even when starving

v1.3.1
  Tweaking:
    Changed 'f'ight, 'F'ight, and 'a'gain to 'a'ttack/'A'ttack,
      this does the same as walking into an enemy but will not move the player
      if there is no enemy there. If you hold a bow while 'a'ttackig you will
      fire arrows automatically. 'A' attacks until death if melee, and does the
      same as 'a' if ranged. 't'hrow still works the same as before.

    chasing you
