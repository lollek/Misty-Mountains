Rogue14 - r2
  Changed name of the slime-mold to fruit (and no, you can't rename it anymore)


Rogue14 - r1
  Changed to GNU/Linux-compability only
  Made the highscore always sort by scores, and not players
  Game now tries to autosaves when killed or crashing
  Added some colors to the game

  Startup/Flags:
    Removed -d flag as it didn't make any sense to me
    Added -c/--colors for enabling colors
    Added -E/--escdelay=NUM, which set the ESCDELAY
    Added -f/--flush, which is used instead of the ROGUEOPT
    Added -F/--hide-floor, which is used instead of the ROGUEOPT
    Added -i/--inv-type, which is used instead of the ROGUEOPT
    Added -j/--jump, which is used instead of the ROGUEOPT
    Added -n/--name, which is used instead of the ROGUEOPT
    Added -p/--passgo, which is used instead of the ROGUEOPT
    Added --restore flags, which does the same as -r
    Added --score flag, which does the same as -s
    Added -S/--seed=NUMBER, which sets the map seed
    Added -t/--terse, which is used instead of the ROGUEOPT
    Added -T/--hide-tomb, which is used instead of the ROGUEOPT
    Added -W/--wizard for debugging
    Added --help flag
    Added --version flag

  Controls:
    Shortened the ESC delay as much as possible
    Removed the '!' command for shell escape
    Removed the 'v' command to check version
    Added '^Z' command, which has the same idea as the '!' command had,
      but instead of forking a new shell, we just pause the game.
      Basically, we send a SIGSTOP to the program.
      After doing your shelly stuff, you can continue with the fg command.
    Removed keypad support and character support for many strange systems
