Rogue14 - 1.2.1
  Save:
    Made save games a tiny bit smaller

Rogue14 - r2
  Changed name of the slime-mold to fruit (and no, you can't rename it anymore)
  Made the counter work a little better

  Controls:
    'x' now switches between the most recently used weapons (e.g. switching
      between the mace and the bow)

  UI:
    Changed from the three inventory types into my own style
    Changed how the 'describe' window looks, similar to the inventory
    Usable items are now shown by default (you don't need to press *)

  Colors:
    Colors are now enabled by default
    Walls are now a bit bigger (they might be grey on some terminals?)
    Gold is now yellow

    Leprechauns are now green

  Trap:
    Added "Suddenly you're somewhere else"-message when stepping on teletrap

  Startup/Flags:
    Removed the old style option parsing
    Added -Q/--quick where you level up when you reach a new level

  Bugfix:
    Picking up items when your pack was empty would cause crash or hang


Rogue14 - r1
  Changed to GNU/Linux-compability only
  Made the highscore always sort by scores, and not players
  Game now tries to autosaves when killed or crashing
  Added some colors to the game

  Startup/Flags:
    Removed -d flag as it didn't make any sense to me
    Added -c/--colors for enabling colors
    Added -E/--escdelay=NUM, which set the ESCDELAY
    Added -f/--flush, which is used instead of the ROGUEOPT
    Added -F/--hide-floor, which is used instead of the ROGUEOPT
    Added -i/--inv-type, which is used instead of the ROGUEOPT
    Added -j/--jump, which is used instead of the ROGUEOPT
    Added -n/--name, which is used instead of the ROGUEOPT

  Controls:
    Shortened the ESC delay as much as possible
    Removed the '!' command for shell escape
    Removed the 'v' command to check version
    Added '^Z' command, which has the same idea as the '!' command had,
      but instead of forking a new shell, we just pause the game.
      Basically, we send a SIGSTOP to the program.
      After doing your shelly stuff, you can continue with the fg command.
    Removed keypad support and character support for many strange systems
